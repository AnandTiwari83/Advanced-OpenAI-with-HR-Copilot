1. In the `secrets.env` file, replace the following values with the ones you copied earlier. Press **CTRL+S** to save the file.

    - **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY**: Replace with your Azure OpenAI Key
    - **AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT**: Replace with your **GPT** Azure OpenAI Deployment Name
    - **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT**: Replace with your Azure OpenAI **Language APIs Endpoint**

1. Run the below command in the terminal to change the directory.

   ```
   cd C:\LabFiles\OpenAIWorkshop\scenarios\incubations\copilot\ChatGPT
   ```
   
1. To run the application from the command line, navigate back to Command Prompt and run the below command:

   > **Note**: You can enter your email address below to get notifications. If not, please leave this field blank and click on **Enter**.

   ```
   streamlit run chatgpt.py
