# Lab 1: Getting Started with Building a Chat Application

## Exercise 1: Open AI Setup and Installation of Applications

In this exercise, you will be setting up the Open AI resource and installing the application locally.
   
### Task 1: Building a ChatGPT-like application on Streamlit with streamingâ€¯ 

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Azure OpenAI** **(1)** in the top search box, then select **Azure OpenAI** **(2)** under services.

1. In the **Azure OpenAI Studio**, select **Deployments** under Management and verify that the **gpt-4** and **text-embedding-ada-002** models are present with the deployment names as **copilot-gpt** and **text-embedding-ada-002**. Review that the model's capacity is set to **15K TPM**. Copy the Azure OpenAI deployment names and model names into the text file for later use.

1. In the LabVM, open File Explorer, navigate to the below-mentioned path, right-click on the `secrets.env` file, and select **Open with Code**.

   ```
   C:\LabFiles\OpenAIWorkshop\scenarios\incubations\copilot\ChatGPT
   ```

1. In the `secrets.env` file, replace the following values with the ones you copied earlier. Click **File->Save** to save the file.

    - **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY**: Replace with your Azure OpenAI Key
    - **AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT**: Replace with your **GPT** model Azure OpenAI Deployment Name
    - **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT**: Replace with your Azure OpenAI **Endpoint**

1. Run the below command in the terminal to change the directory.

   ```
   cd C:\LabFiles\OpenAIWorkshop\scenarios\incubations\copilot\ChatGPT
   ```
   
1. To run the application from the command line, navigate back to Command Prompt and run the below command:

   > **Note**: You can enter your email address below to get notifications. If not, please leave this field blank and click on **Enter**.

   ```
   pip install openai==0.28.0
   ```
   
   ```
   streamlit run chatgpt.py
   ```
   
1. Once the execution of `streamlit run chatgpt.py` is completed, a locally hosted demo application will be opened in the web browser.
